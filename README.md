 # My HTML and CSS Journey

This repository documents my learning journey with HTML and CSS, focusing on creating a responsive web page called "ResponsiveCar." Through this project, I’ve explored the basics of web development and how to make designs adapt to different screen sizes, from desktops to small devices like phones.

## About My Journey
I started with HTML to structure web content, learning tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` to organize a page. Then, I dove into CSS to style it, experimenting with colors, layouts, and responsiveness. This project, "ResponsiveCar," is a milestone where I applied these skills to build a page that looks great on any device. It’s been a fun process of trial, error, and improvement!

## Making a Web Page Responsive
A responsive web page adjusts to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience. Here are the main points I learned:
- **Viewport Meta Tag**: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` ensures the page scales correctly on mobile devices.
- **Media Queries**: CSS rules like `@media (max-width: 768px)` change styles based on screen size.
- **Flexbox**: These layouts help rearrange content dynamically (e.g., stacking elements on small screens).

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file with the car page structure.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file with responsive styles.
- `Screenshot 2025-07-01 114856.png`: Desktop view of the responsive car page.
- `Screenshot 2025-07-01 115744.png`: Small device view of the responsive car page.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mowaisqarni/ResponsiveCar.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Resize the window or use developer tools (F12 > Toggle device toolbar) to see responsiveness.

## How Responsiveness Works in This Project
- The desktop view (above) shows a wide layout with car details side by side.
- On small devices, the layout stacks elements vertically using media queries (e.g., `@media (max-width: 500px)`).
- Flexible units and relative positioning ensure the design adapts smoothly.

## Testing Responsiveness
- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- Use developer tools (F12) to simulate devices like iPhone or iPad.
- Resize the browser to see the page adjust between desktop and mobile views.

## Next Steps
- Add more media queries for tablets (e.g., `max-width: 1024px`).
- Experiment with CSS Grid for a different layout.
- Include more images or animations to enhance the car page.
